# MANIFIESTAPP

Manifiesta is a festival that takes place every year in September in Belgium, the festival of solidarity, with concerts, debates or artistic activities.

Here is the official mobile app allowing first of all to see the programme more easily and to put your favourites there.

The application is made with [Ionic Angular](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/overview)

See the package json file to see automatic script to run, test and build. Information for deployed on the Play and Apple Store will come later.
